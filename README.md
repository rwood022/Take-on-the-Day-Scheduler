## Description
"Take on the Day Scheduler" will help the working user organize their schedule hour by hour. At the top of the page there is a current day, date, and time display. By clicking in the time block, the user is able to type tasks/memo/notes/reminder and save their input by pressing the blue save button. When each hour passes the color of the time block changes. Present hour is red, past hour(s) are gray, and future hour(s) are green. 

## How to install/ run application: 
This application is able to run on the users global computer. It is run with a HTML/ CSS/ JavaScript and jQwery. The day, date, and time feature at the header of the page is ran by Moment.js.

## How to use "Take on the Day Scheduler":
The user simply adds a task/note/memo/reminder in the corresponding hour block. The input is saved and can be changed throughout the day. When the user checks their scheduler they can also view an automatic color change of the current hour block. This helps the user quickly identify their past, present, and future tasks. 

## Credits:
To complete this application, I referanced activities taught at Georgia Tech Bootcamp, W3 Schools, and the assistance of the instructor, TA, and Tutor.
